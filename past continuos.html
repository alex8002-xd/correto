        <h2>What is the past Continuous</h2>
        <p>The Past Continuous is an English verb tense used to describe actions that were occurring at a specific time in the past.</p>
<img src="Sheets-Database.-Past-simple-and-Past-continuous-_1-360x432-removebg-preview.png" alt="work" width="150 px" style="float: right;">
        The Past Continuous is used to describe actions that occurred at a specific and known time in the past or over a period of time.
<ul>
<li>Yesterday at 10 p.m. - Yesterday at 10 p.m., I was climbing the tree. - I was climbing a tree.</li>
<li>At 5 o'clock yesterday evening - At 5 pm yesterday, my sister was flying from Sydney. - my sister was flying from Sydney.</li>
<li>At the same time two years ago - At the same time two years ago, we were visiting my parents. - we were visiting my parents.</li>
<li>She was still dancing at midnight. - She was still dancing at midnight.</li>
<li>Last night at 1 a.m. - Last night at 1 a.m., I was preparing my speech. - I was preparing my speech.</li><br>
    
A precise moment in the Past Continuous Tense can be specified or interrupted by another, shorter action, expressed in the Simple Past Tense.
